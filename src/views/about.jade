      p Wikipedia is the encyclopedia that anybody can edit. And "thanks" is a free compliment that anybody can give. But both can sometimes be hard to do.
      p This site should make editing Wikipedia easier for the would-be editor be showing examples of how simple and non-intimidating some of the edits are. And it should make saying thank-you easier for the would-be Decent Fellow Human by giving a one-click option for sending a automated thank-you to the editor through Wikipedia's API.
