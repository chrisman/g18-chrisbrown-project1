# Personal project

This is my personal project. It's basically just GET and POST requests against the wikipedia API.

Here's the plan.

1. GET [recent edits](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=help&modules=feedrecentchanges)

2. The user browses summaries of recent edits

3. The user can at their discretion reward editors for their edits by POSTing to the [thank](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=help&modules=thank) action.
